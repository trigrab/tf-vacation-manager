## SCP connection to server

We could use:
https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko

* make server and path configurable
* decide if old file gets deleted or moved

## GUI

* ~~read template from local disk~~
* ~~read template from appdata if it exists~~
* ~~implement datepicker for date fields~~
* ~~add/remove vacation file from server~~

## Deployment

* most of our users use Windows, so we need to deploy with python for windows
  * see https://wiki.python.org/moin/deployment
* make configurable
